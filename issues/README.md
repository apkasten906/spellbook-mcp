# Issues Staging Folder

This folder is used for drafting and staging issues with AI tools (such as ChatGPT or Copilot) before they are published to GitHub Issues.

- The canonical backlog and issue tracker is managed in GitHub Issues.
- Files here are for collaboration, refinement, and automation workflows.
- Periodically review and publish finalized issues to GitHub, then archive or remove them from this folder.
